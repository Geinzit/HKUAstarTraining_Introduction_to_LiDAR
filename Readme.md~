# Introdution to LiDAR
*Maodian Huang*

## What is LiDAR?
> What do you get when you add wings to a LiDAR scanner?

> "GLiDAR!"

**LiDAR**: Light Detection and Ranging

- a remote sensing technology that uses laser light to measure distances and create high-resolution 3D maps or point clouds of the surrounding environment.

- distances are calculated by first having a LiDAR system emit laser pulses towards an area. When the laser pulses encounter objects in the environment, they reflect back towards the LiDAR sensor.

### What are point clouds?
> They're like clouds, but made out of points LMAO!

**Point Clouds**: Collections of 3D data points that represent the spiral coordinates of objects or surfaces in a three-dimensional space. Each point in a point cloud is (usually) defined by its X, Y, Z coordinates, capturing the position of a specific location in the envirionment.

### Advantages of LiDAR

- High Precision and Accuracy

- All-Weather Capability

- Long Distance

- etc.

### Application of LiDAR

- **Autonomous Vehicles**: perceive the surrounding vehicles, detect obstacles, assist navigation.

- **Mapping and Surveying**: create detailed topographic maps, digital models(building, landscapes)

- **Remote sensing**: study vegetation, monitor forest health etc

- etc.

- **MOST IMPORTANTLY, widely used in localization and navigation algorithms for robots competing in the Robomaster competitions**

## How does LiDAR work?

1. get a supported hardware
2. preprocessing
3. labeling, segmentation and detection
4. calibration and sensor fusion
5. navigation and mapping

## How does LiDAR, really, work?

Below is an example demonstration

We'll be using a Livox Mid 70 LiDAR sensor for demonstration.

### Connecting to the Computing Device

### Connect with ROS, with a driver package

### Run the localization & navigation algorithm 

### Profit
